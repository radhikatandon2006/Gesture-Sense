Gesture-Based Finger Detection System:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how computer vision and real-time hand landmark detection can be used to interpret human hand gestures without physical contact.
It implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system that detects a user’s hand through a webcam feed and counts the number of fingers raised. 
I used MediaPipe’s Hand Tracking solution to extract hand landmarks and OpenCV for video capture, processing, and visualisation.
The detected finger count is displayed live on the screen along with visual hand landmarks.
It can be used as an assistive technology by allowing users with limited mobility to interact with digital systems through touchless hand gestures instead of physical input devices.
